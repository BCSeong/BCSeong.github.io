# Computational Optics and Imaging

My research centers on optical system design, calibration, and integration for inspection and metrology—from microscale (computational microscopy) to industrial scale (inline inspection). I work on (1) designing and optimizing phase-based optics (binary phase filters, wavefront coding), (2) developing reconstruction and calibration algorithms for interferometric and lens-based imaging, and (3) applying these to high-throughput semiconductor and industrial inspection. My Ph.D. focused on extended depth-of-field microscopy using learning-based binary phase filters and image deconvolution at the [Computational Imaging & Instrumentation Lab (CII)](https://cii-yonsei.com), Yonsei University. I now lead R&D at [Koh Young Technology](https://kohyoung.com/en/) on computational imaging and interferometry-based inspection, with international collaboration (AIT, Fraunhofer IPM). Selected research themes and relevant publications are summarized below.

## Extended Depth-of-Field Microscopy with Binary Phase Filters

Extending the depth of field (DoF) of optical systems is essential for 3D inspection and high-throughput imaging. I have worked on jointly optimizing binary phase filters and image reconstruction—including end-to-end learning of phase profiles and deconvolution networks—to achieve large DoF extension (e.g., 15.5×) while preserving resolution. This includes topology optimization for depth-of-focus extension and integration with light-sheet and other microscope architectures.

## Phase Retrieval and Differential Phase-Contrast Imaging

Phase contains critical information in transparent and weakly scattering samples. I have developed untrained deep learning-based methods for differential phase-contrast microscopy that avoid the need for paired training data and reduce acquisition or calibration burden. I have also contributed to polarization-sensitive and intensity-based diffraction tomography for quantitative phase and 3D imaging.

## Light Sheet and Axi-Symmetric Phase Optics

Light sheet fluorescence microscopy enables fast, low-phototoxicity 3D imaging. I have worked on axi-symmetric binary phase filters for light sheet generation and related system design, as well as oblique light sheet configurations for high-speed large-area imaging (e.g., conjunctival goblet cells) in collaboration with CII and clinical partners.

## Tomographic and 3D Quantitative Imaging

I have contributed to tomographic and 3D imaging methods for biological and industrial applications—including dual-parameter tomographic imaging of attenuation and backscattering for tumor spheroid evaluation, and direct replication of micro-optical elements (e.g., Fresnel zone plate arrays) for system integration.

## Industrial Inspection and Metrology (Koh Young Technology)

At [Koh Young Technology](https://kohyoung.com/en/), I lead R&D on computational imaging and interferometry-based inspection for semiconductor and industrial applications. Current work includes inline photometry-stereo inspection (AOI-AXIA) with depth reconstruction and calibration pipelines, and interferometry-based inspection (ZenStar) with synthetic-wavelength holography and phase-unwrapping algorithms, in collaboration with the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT) and Fraunhofer IPM. This work is oriented toward robust, high-throughput solutions rather than traditional academic publication; relevant patents and product documentation are available upon request.
