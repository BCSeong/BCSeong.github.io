I am an optical and computational imaging engineer with a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering (Yonsei University, 2023). I am currently an Optical Engineer and Team Manager at **Koh Young Technology**, leading R&D on computational imaging and interferometry-based inspection for semiconductor and industrial applications. I collaborate with AIT (Austria) and Fraunhofer IPM (Germany).

My research interests are in computational optics and imaging: optical system design, calibration, and integration for inspection and metrology. I have hands-on experience in interferometric imaging (digital holography, OCT, white-light interferometry), wavefront coding, structured light encoding, and image reconstruction. I aim to translate advanced optical concepts into robust solutions for high-throughput semiconductor and industrial inspection.
