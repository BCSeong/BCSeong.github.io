[CV](/cv/)

I am currently an Optical Engineer and Optical Engineering Team Manager at [Koh Young Technology](https://kohyoung.com/en/) (Yongin, Republic of Korea), where I lead R&D on computational imaging and interferometry-based inspection for semiconductor and industrial applications. I collaborate with international research institutes including the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT) and Fraunhofer IPM (Germany). Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at Yonsei University (2023), advised by Prof. Chulmin Joo at the [Computational Imaging & Instrumentation Lab (CII)](https://cii-yonsei.com). My dissertation focused on extended depth-of-field microscopy using learning-based binary phase filters and image deconvolution. I have been honored with the Excellence Thesis Fellowship (Yonsei University, 2022), Brain Korea 21 Scholarship and Academy Research Fellowship (NRF Korea, 2018–2022).

My research interests are broadly in computational optics and imaging, with a particular focus on optical system design, calibration, and integration for inspection and metrology. I have hands-on experience in interferometric imaging (digital holography, optical coherence tomography, white-light interferometry), wavefront coding (phase plates, spatial light modulators), structured light encoding, and image reconstruction algorithms. I aim to translate advanced optical concepts into robust, cost-effective solutions for high-throughput semiconductor and industrial inspection systems.
